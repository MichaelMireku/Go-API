The routes are defined as follows:

#Note


=======
>>>>>>> 
 The PATCH HTTP method is typically used for partial updates, and in this case, it's used for the checkout and return operations. However, these operations could be implemented using the PUT method as well. The choice between PATCH and PUT depends on your design preferences and RESTful API principles.
